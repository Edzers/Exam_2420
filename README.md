# Exam_2420
# Part 1
``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade 
sudo reboot
```
# Part 2 
Keybindings used to make the changes include the following:
First, gg to get to the top of the buffer.

Entering insert mode first to replace the -eq 1 with -eq 0, moving with the arrowkeys, or k(up) h(left) l(right) j(down)

To replace the mistyped V with C (celsius), I used /V to find the instances of V, and then manually entered insert mode with i to replace.

As for the numbs, I used the command :s/numbs/:digit: to replace it, as well as :1,11s/eco/echo/g to replace all instances of "eco" with "echo" through lines 1 to 11 (the entire script). Then, after I was done editing, I exited vim with :q!.

# Part 3
Found the first screenshot by searching with /options and scrolling down until I found the correct option for printing the current boot users.

Found the second screenshot with /priority for the -p command.

# Part 4
Put script in bin directory.
```
#!/bin/bash


# Use grep to find the users
users=$(grep -E "^[^:]+:[^:]+:[1-5][0-9][0-9][0-9]:" /etc/passwd)

# Use awk to extract the name, UID, and login shell for each user
echo "$users" | awk -F: '{print $1", "$3", "$7}'

# Print all currently logged in users using the 'w' command

echo "Users currently logged in are:"
login=$(who | awk '{print $1}')
echo "$login"

# Get the output and save it to the motd file
echo "$users" > /etc/motd
echo "$login" >> /etc/motd
